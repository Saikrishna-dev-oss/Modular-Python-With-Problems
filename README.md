# 🧠 Modular Python With Problems

A curated collection of Python programs, organized by topic for fast reference, hands-on practice, and modular learning.

## 📦 What's Inside

This repository contains standalone Python programs grouped by concept. Each folder is a mini-library of examples and exercises — ideal for learners, educators, and developers brushing up on syntax or prepping for interviews.
